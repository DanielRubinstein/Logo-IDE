SLogo Addition
===================

###Estimation: before looking at the old code:
-how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
I think it will probably take around 45mn. 

-how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I'll need to add a way of picking the image in the frontend. The backend doesn't need to be aware that I changed the turtle image so I won't need to do use observers. Currently we can see if a turtle is active when we hover over it so this information shouldn't be hard to retrieve, but then I will need to create a menu containing this. I'll probably need to edit around 4/5 files. I don't remember their names at all but I think
I should recognize them fairly easily when I open up the code.
